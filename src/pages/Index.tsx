                How I Can Help You

                  I help product teams move faster, think clearer, and build smarterâ€”by combining deep domain expertise with battle-tested product frameworks and a people-first approach. With over 12 years of product leadership experience in the music-tech space, I've worked across B2C and B2B, helping launch, scale, and sometimes gloriously fail products. Every step brought its own lesson, and I use that knowledge today to empower others to do better work.

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">What I Do</h3>
                <p className="text-md text-muted-foreground mb-6">
                  I focus on building high-performing product teams with a culture of ownership, trust, and experimentation. My approach involves coaching teams to make outcome-driven decisions using OKRs, value stream mapping, and discovery best practices. I specialize in designing product strategies that align user needs with business goals, and I craft operationally efficient solutions for highly complex financial and rights-based ecosystems.
                </p>
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">How I Lead</h3>
                <p className="text-md text-muted-foreground mb-8">
                  Leadership is a team sport. I aim to cultivate psychological safety, curiosity, and joy within every team I work with. I've helped establish forums for collaborative planning, celebrated failure to normalize learning, and actively mentored team members in product craft.
                </p>
                <p className="text-md text-muted-foreground mb-8">
                  I also speak at product events and mentor aspiring PMs through programs like Product School and Growth School.
